# Personal Development Repository of KeePass

This is my personal Github fork of the Keepass source code. master includes
a small set of a patches which haven't yet made it to upstream.

For more information on KeePass see the website: http://keepass.info

## Applied Patches
 * Safer file transactions: verifies that the temporary Keepass file was
   actually created before deleting the original. Makes unreliable remote
   synchronization safer.
 * *.kdbx.tmp recovery: if an orphaned tmp file is found, completes the
   pending transaction if the original kdbx file is already deleted. Makes
   unreliable remote synchronization safer.
